# TODO LIST

## TODO

- [ ] (BENC) add benchmarks for patches
- [ ] (PERF) appended: WeakSet => could be used to determine if the element was external to the tree, so we could avoid cloning it
- [ ] (PERF) remove some closures, expecially the proxy traps, the addLink and actionLink
- [ ] (PERF) getOwnPropertySymbols adds some overhead on copy: we could disable it with a flag if necessary. Is it worth?
- [ ] (PERF) store type somewhere for fast lookup
- [ ] (PERF) typeof v is taken two times, the second time for checking if it's a function; solve this
- [ ] (FEAT) possibility to convert patches in standard RFC JSON format
- [ ] (FEAT) possibly implement those types: TypedArray, DataView(?), File(?), Blob(?), FileList(?), DomException(?)
- [ ] (FEAT) possibly implement those proxy traps: defineProperty, setPrototypeOF, preventExtensions, ownKeys, apply(?)
- [ ] (FEAT) allow switching implementations
- [ ] (TYPE) applyPatches should have a conditional return type

## IN PROGRESS

- [ ] (BENC) add benchmarks for different setups

## DONE
- [x] (FEAT) added patches
- [x] (BUGS) if I have multiple link to a child for the same parent, the append action is only done once
