**Structura.js** is a very fast and lightweight Typescript library which allows to create immutable states with a mutable syntax. It is based on the idea of structural sharing.

The library is very similar to [Immer.js](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), but it's much more performant (~24x on average) and it is better at solving some edge cases like circular references, multiple references to the same object, transpositions etc... It also avoids freezing the resulting object at runtime, but it only does it at compile time, which is again a much more performant way to do it.
